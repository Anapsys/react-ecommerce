# react-ecommerce by jobsimulator.dev

### Getting Started

First install the node dependencies

```bash
npm i
```
and then run the app locally with

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend
```

Once you're running locally, start working on [these issues first](https://github.com/developer-job-simulation/react-ecommerce/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22).

To make working with Tailwind easy, we recommend you install [TailwindCSS Intellisense in VSCode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code) to add autocomplete + linting.
